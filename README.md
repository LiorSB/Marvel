# Marvel
**Project Background-**

Marvel is a desktop application that can scan for several ports through a local network and make a connection with a chosen protocol. You can enter IPs into the program manually, with an auto IP scanner, a file that holds IPs or a segment to scan. The program will check the IP's connectivity and display in different tabs those that managed to make a connection and those that failed. After making a connection, Marvel will scan every computer for artifacts and later process and parse them, which will later be uploaded to the main machince/cloud.
